Municipal Bond Liquidity and Default Risk, the article from volumn 4, 2017, Journal of Finance
in the article, the author belived that the default risk and liquidity are the first and second factor for the Municiplal bond
spread. we have to notice that, we do not have to consider the tax factor because municipal bonds are all tex-exampt.

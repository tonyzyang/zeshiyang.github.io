<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/28391909">人为什么会产生「他（她）也喜欢你」这种错觉？</a><br>

Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss. But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.<br>
我们有的人普通平淡，有的光亮柔和，还有的明亮耀眼。但偶尔你也会发现像彩虹一样灿烂的人，如果遇到了，你会觉得他/她没人能比。</br>

这个牛逼了哈哈哈：<br>

“A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself
is just a cow. A meadow by itself is just grass, flowers. And the sun peeking
through the trees is just a beam of light. But you put them all together and it
can be magic.”<br>

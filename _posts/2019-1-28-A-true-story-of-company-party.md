来武汉的这—版ppt最后的视频要重做，那边做完发给我视频如果插入ppt就特别不清晰，照片全都糊的，但单独放视频的话音频特别的嘈杂，根本不行。

The last video of this version of ppt in Wuhan has to be redone. After that, I will send a video to me. If I insert the ppt, it is especially unclear. The photos are all pasted, but the audio is especially noisy when I put the video alone.

所以就让我把所有视频里的照片都做在了ppt里，多插入了二十多张，再做上动画和自动的切换时间。终于做好ppt之后去找负责后台的师傅，突然告诉我们不能放ppt, 
只能分别放音频和图片，这个之前对接的人根本没跟我们提过，我们也不知道还有这样的要求，我就把ppt里所有的照片57张都摘出来了。

So let me put all the photos in the video in the ppt, insert more than twenty, and then do animation and automatic switching time. Finally, after doing ppt, I went to the master who was in charge of the background. I suddenly told us that I could not put ppt.
I can only put audio and pictures separately. The people who had docked before did not mention it to us. We don't know that there are such requests. I took all the 57 photos in the ppt.

其实那个师傅那里也可以放ppt, 就是得切换，他獭得换，就职负我们说不可以，后来磨了他半天又松口说可以用ios系统放ppt 。

In fact, the master can also put ppt, it is necessary to switch, he has to change, incumbent negative we said no, and later grinded him for a long time and said that you can use the ios system to put ppt.

但是office做的ppt用ios系统放的时候音频和视频有问题，我们又没有苹果电脑，又拜托的公司计财的—个负责公司年会的人把它苹果电脑的ppt发给我们（周五年会拷给他的时候就是苹果的不行所以重做了一遍）

But the office made ppt with ios system when the audio and video problems, we have no Apple computer, but also the company's financial planning - a person in charge of the company's annual meeting sent it Apple's ppt to us(Friday When the annual meeting was copied to him, it was Apple’s failure to do it,so we make a new one).

我又把我改的ppt发给他，跟他视频着指挥着让他在苹果上改。最终准备了三套方案，第—套是苹果版ppt,第二套是office版ppt (我自己带去的电脑没有转接口，他们又找了个吴总让人家送来—个电脑，结果是wps的，播放的时候有点卡不太流畅，还会有—点延时）第三套是—个人操控ppt, 另—个人操控音频（鉴千我们全员都上了，就找了武汉招待我们的人拉着他教他昨放）

I sent him the ppt that I changed, and videotaped with him to let him change on Apple. Finally, three sets of plans were prepared. The first set was the apple version of ppt, and the second set was the office version of ppt. (The computer I brought to me did not have a transfer interface. They found another piece of Wu who sent the home to a computer. The result was Wps, a little bit of card is not smooth when playing, there will be - point delay) The third set is - personal control ppt, another - personal control audio (Jianqian, we all went up, we found Wuhan entertainment Our people took him to teach him to put it last year)

第二天去试了—下苹果版的ppt没问题，但是因为少了根音频线，音频师傅拒绝给我们切换，所以就还是用的第三种方案，我放ppt, 另—个人放音频，每个音频播放前需要缓冲，不好把控，我俩就有—些偏差，而且最终是有—个背景音乐没有播放成功。


I tried it the next day - the apple version of the ppt is no problem, but because the root audio line is missing, the audio master refused to switch to us, so I still use the third option, I put ppt, another - personal audio, Every audio needs to be buffered before playing, it is not easy to control, we have some deviations, and eventually there is - background music is not played successfully.

而且周末赶上降温，场馆里没开空调，我们找了个地方做ppt，等着前面的节目排完

And on the weekend, catching up with the temperature, there is no air conditioning in the venue, we found a place to do ppt, waiting for the previous program to finish


真的特别冷，大家找了个热水壶，把矿泉水倒进去烧开了再倒出来拿在手里抱着

It was really cold. Everyone found a hot water bottle, poured the mineral water into it and boiled it, then poured it out and held it in his hand.

终于彩排完了，吃完饭大概九点多回到宾馆十点，稍微改了下ppt他们又凑在一起合了一下弄到十一点多
Finally, the rehearsal was over. After dinner, I returned to the hotel at 10 o'clock, and changed the ppt a little. They got together and got together to get more than eleven o'clock.

其实要是一开始就说ppt和音频分开播，那么ppt都不需要后面那么多事，还联系别人帮忙改了
In fact, if you say ppt and audio separately from the beginning, then ppt does not need not only so many things behind, but also contact others to help change
